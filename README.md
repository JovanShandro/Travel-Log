# Travel Log

This a small fullstack application I have built in my free time. The server is completely written in Typescript, whereas in the client, Typescript is used for the benefit of using the graphql code generator.

## Setup

You first need to start a redis server locally and also create a postgres database named `travel_log`.

## How to run

You can run both client and server using the following command:

```bash
yarn # install dependencies
yarn dev # start for development
```

You can access the frontend on `localhost:8080` and the backend on `localhost:8000`

## Todo

- [ ] Containerize the application
